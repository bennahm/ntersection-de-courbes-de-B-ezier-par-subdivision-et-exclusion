Let’s now consider the problem of the intersection of two B´ezier 2D-curves of degree n and m respectively. 1. Each curve is included in the convex hull of its control polygon. Thus, if these two convex hulls do not intersect, we conclude by the exclusion principle that the two curves do not intersect..
